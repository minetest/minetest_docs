:description: Adding Content to Minetest
:keywords: node, register, definition

Minetest's Lua API can be used to add new content to Minetest. This includes nodes (blocks), items, entities, ABMs and LBMs.

IMPORTANT: You may only call registering functions at load time. Content cannot be registered dynamically while the world is running.

== Functions

=== `minetest.register_node(id, definition)

Registers (adds) a new Node into the game. Each node has a unique identifier.

TIP: You should use IDs in the form of `modname:nodeid`. For example, if your mod is called "mymod", use an id of `mymod:myblock`
