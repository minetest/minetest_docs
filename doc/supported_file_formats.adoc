:description: The file formats Minetest supports.
:keywords: fileformats

Minetest is able to read several types of file formats for use as assets in-game, each with varying usecase and support.

== Images
[grid="all"]
[options="header",stripes="even",cols="^.^,<.^,^.^,^.^"]
|===
| Format
^| General Usecase
| Can be written by Lua
| Can be read by Lua

| PNG (`.png`)
| All-round good losslessly compressed image format.
| Yes (`minetest.encode_png()` ^(5.5+)^) (Third-party library ^(-5.4)^)
| Yes (Third-party library)

| JPEG (`.jpg .jpeg`)
| Lossily compressed images (e.g. photorealistic skyboxes and large textures)
| No
| No

| TGA (`.tga`)
| Easy to programmatically encode and decode due to being a simple image format, and is to be preferred over BMP. Might be smaller than PNG at times due to a smaller file header.
| Yes (Third-party library)
| No

| BMP (`.bmp`)
| Another simple image format (but more complex than TGA). Kept due to IrrlichtMt depending on it internally.
| No
| No
|===

Prior to 5.5.0, Minetest used to be able to load PCX, PPM, PSD, PVR, DDS, WAL, LMP and RGB as part of Irrlicht's image loading capabilities. These are no longer supported and should be converted to a format that is still supported.

=== Optimizing images
Normally when you export images with a regular image editor it is not exported in the most optimized way possible, and your editor will also embed metadata into the image. It is therefore standard practice to optimize your images in order to reduce their file size. This will not only reduce the size of your assets when a player downloads it but also reduce the time spent for media to be downloaded before joining a multiplayer server.

==== PNG
For losslessly optimizing PNG images, http://optipng.sourceforge.net/[optipng] is a good tool. It is a command-line program that is run from the command prompt or terminal.

When run with no arguments optipng optimizes completely losslessly (no color, metadata or transparency is lost). However there are arguments in addition that can be added in order to further reduce the size or to preserve specific data you might want to keep. A more exhaustive list of arguments and what they do can be found in optipng's manual or in the help text available with `optipng -h`.

[grid="all"]
[options="header",stripes="even",cols="^.^,^.^,^.^"]
|===
| Argument
| Description
| Safe?

| -strip all
| Strips all image metadata your image editor has embedded into the image.
| Yes (Image metadata is mostly useless for images used with Minetest)

| -o7 -zm1-9
| Sets both optipng and zlib's optimization/compression levels to the highest available. Will take significantly longer but can further reduce the file size.
| Yes

| -nc
| Disables color type reduction. This is necessary if you have color data you want to preserve in transparent pixels, such as ones in leaf textures.
| N/A

A general-purpose script for optimizing images as aggressively as possible without losing color information can be found in Minetest Game: https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/blob/master/utils/optimize_textures.sh[optimize_textures.sh]

=== Third-party libraries for writing and/or reading
If you would like to write or read image files in Lua for a format the engine does not support, there are various libraries available as mods you can use.

==== PNG
===== Writing & Reading
* `modlib` (https://content.minetest.net/packages/LMD/modlib/[ContentDB], https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib[GitHub])

==== TGA
===== Writing
// The actual repository is https://github.com/EliasFleckenstein03/tga_encoder/ but it is outdated and doesn't contain compression support or performance improvements that exist in the MineClone2 source tree.
* `tga_encoder` (https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/src/branch/master/mods/CORE/tga_encoder[MeseHub])

== Models
Minetest's support of various model formats can be seen as lacking. This is a side-effect of Minetest relying on the aging Irrlicht graphics engine which mostly only has support for old or obsolete model formats.
